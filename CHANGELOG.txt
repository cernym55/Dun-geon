--- v0.3.3 | 05/19/2020 (Latest)
 - Added the world map.
     The M key and 'map' command open a world map window which shows visited
     and adjacent unexplored rooms in the world.
     Rooms can be highlighted with the cursor for more information about what's
     in them. The cursor can be disabled for a better view.
 - Added diagonal movement.
     Keys around the WASD cluster (Q, E, Z, C) can be used for convenient
     diagonal movement consisting of two move commands one after another.


--- v0.3.2 | 05/08/2020
 - Reworked procedural generation of rooms.
     The generation algorithm is no longer purely random and now considers
     factors such as how many rooms you've found or which world you are in.
     There is also a limit to how many rooms can appear.
 - Added a highlight effect to the field or entity you are touching.
     This makes it easier to tell which way your character is facing and which
     objects you can interact with.
 - Separated handling of UI commands such as "quit".
     UI commands no longer behave like ingame commands such as "move". They can
     no longer be repeated or chained and take no arguments.


--- v0.3.1 | 05/06/2020
 - Added dark rooms.
     In dark rooms you can only see things in a certain radius around
     the player character.
 - The camera is now centered on the player character in certain rooms.
 - Fixed being able to repeat the quit command, which required confirming
     all prompts before being able to continue.
 - Fixed the multiplication of command repeats when performing the last command
     multiple times.
 - Limited the number of repeats of a command to 500.
 - Fixed a bug when deleting characters from the command input where the text
     displayed accurately while the input was being deleted off by one.


--- v0.3.0 | 05/02/2020 ---
 - Reworked the user interface entirely. The game now uses ncurses to provide
     a polished and performant visual-textual experience.
     The game can be controlled via WASD or the arrow keys, however the classic
     text command system has not been done away with. Text commands can be
     entered by pressing the spacebar to open up a prompt.
 - Dun-geon has colors!


--- v0.2.1 | 04/26/2020 ---
 - Added Hallway rooms.


--- v0.2.0 | 04/20/2020 ---
 - Most parts of the game have been completely rewritten. In this version,
     the original functionality found in v0.1.0 has been replicated.
     More cool stuff coming soon!
 - Walls are now considered an interactive map object and display a message
     when approached.


--- v0.1.0 | 01/08/2017 ---
 - Initial playable version. Features a pre-set character, limited
     UI and one world of random empty box-layout rooms.
 - Added a repeat command under the keywords "a" ([a]gain), "again",
     "repeat" and "last".
     Repeat commands can be performed multiple times by specifying a number.
     This replaces the memorized last command with the new multiplied command.
     Specifying a direction changes it while keeping the rest of the command.
 - Fixed a fatal bug where rooms could still spawn entrances leading outside
     the world grid.
