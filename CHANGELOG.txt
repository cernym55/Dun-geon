--- 01/08/2017 --- (latest)
 - Dun-geon is now licensed under the GNU GPLv3.
 - Initial playable version. Features a pre-set character, limited
     UI and one world of random empty box-layout rooms.
 - Added a repeat command under the keywords "a" ([a]gain), "again",
     "repeat" and "last".
     Repeat commands can be performed multiple times by specifying a number.
     This replaces the memorized last command with the new multiplied command.
     Specifying a direction changes it while keeping the rest of the command.
 - Fixed a fatal bug where rooms could still spawn entrances leading outside
     the world grid.
