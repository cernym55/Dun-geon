--- v0.2.0 | 04/20/2020 --- (latest)
 - Most parts of the game have been completely rewritten. In this version,
     the original functionality found in v0.1.0 has been replicated.
     More cool stuff coming soon!
 - Walls are now considered an interactive map object and display a message
     when approached.


--- v0.1.0 | 01/08/2017 ---
 - Initial playable version. Features a pre-set character, limited
     UI and one world of random empty box-layout rooms.
 - Added a repeat command under the keywords "a" ([a]gain), "again",
     "repeat" and "last".
     Repeat commands can be performed multiple times by specifying a number.
     This replaces the memorized last command with the new multiplied command.
     Specifying a direction changes it while keeping the rest of the command.
 - Fixed a fatal bug where rooms could still spawn entrances leading outside
     the world grid.
