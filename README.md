# Dun-geon  
### A dun-fueled experience for all

**Author:** Matyas Cerny (Matt Black)  
**Initial release date:** 12/19/2016

Dun-geon is a spinoff of my earlier game [DunMash](https://bitbucket.org/torchie8/dunmash). The aim of this project is mostly educational, to further my knowledge of C++, the OOP paradigm and various useful programming practices.  
The project is still in a very early stage, with the first working test build with functional display and no major bugs released on 12/24/2016.

For help related to the game itself, an ingame help section will be implemented once the game is in an actually playable state.

### Build instructions

- Clone the repository.
- To build for Linux, run `make`.
